# Todo

The following is a to-do list for all the core + extra features I would like to add to Search GPT

## Userflow

Search GPT is designed for the user to use it in the following way:

- User goes to URL, sees nice branding, a search bar, and a 2-sentence explanation of what it is and how to use it
- User types something to search
- User gets sent to new tab with their search query of [ChatGPT Share](https://chatgpt.com/share) links

User can enhance their experience by setting it as the default page if they would like search ChatGPT links only.

## Todo list

- [x] Logic for searching (should be a function that maps a string to a URL)
- [ ] Nice UI (should only have a title and search bar at this point)
- [ ] Add search engines
- [ ] Complete UI based on reqs
