A minimal React + Vite web app that lets you search shared ChatGPT links across the web using DuckDuckGo.
Built out of curiosity about how rerouting works for ChatGPT URLs discovered through Google dorking and similar scraping techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Search for shared ChatGPT conversations from one place
- Utilizes DuckDuckGo for clean, anonymous querying
- Simple and fast frontend built with React + Vite

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAmanM/search-gpt
cd search-gpt
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 💡 Motivation

This was a small side project exploring how re-routing and scraping interact with publicly shared ChatGPT links, inspired by the patterns exposed through Google dorking.
